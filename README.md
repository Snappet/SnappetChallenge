# Snappet Challenge

Waar heeft mijn klas vandaag aan gewerkt?

## Project setup

In order to get the application running, you are going to need [.NET Core 2.1](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/macos) . Once you've got that setup, fire up your favorite shell and follow the instructions:

1. Navigate to `src/Snappet.Web`
2. Run `dotnet run`
3. Browse to `http://localhost:5000`
4. Profit! :-)

### Build
The client application has been pre-built so that you don't have to do it. If you would like to play around and build it yourself, you are going to need [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) . Once you get Node installed follow the instructions:

1. Navigate to `src/Snappet.Web/ClientApp`
2. Run `npm install` to restore package dependencies
3. Run `npm run build` to get the client application built
