## Technology

To complete the SnappetChallenge I used a combination of the next technologies and tools:
- **Angular 2** is the next version of Googleï¿½s massively popular MV* framework for building complex applications in the browser (and beyond).
- **JSMP** is a package manager for the SystemJS universal module loader, built on top of the dynamic ES6 module loader.
This enables rappid development and hot-reloading in the browser.
- **ASP.Net Core** is a lean and composable framework for building web and cloud applications. ASP.NET Core is fully open source and available on GitHub. ASP.NET Core is available on Windows, Mac, and Linux.

I used Test driven development to create this application. A test project is included for each project.
