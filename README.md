# SnappetChallenge
At [Snappet](http://www.snappet.org), we care about data and we care about code. When we interview for development positions, we want to see code and we want to discuss code. That's why we want candidates to show some work on our challenge. This challenge is not meant to cost you tons of time. A few hours should be enough. The challenge is defined very broadly. You could spend weeks on it, or half an hour. We understand that in 2 hours, you can only do so much. Don't worry about completeness, work on something that works and shows your skills.

### Idea

Sadly I can't spend much time on the challenge every day. I still have to be professional and consider my current tasks as a priority and I have them a lot now. Besides, I'm a father of a two-year-old which also takes a lot of time but on the other hand, I'm very interested in your position and I want to show my best side as an engineer and I don't want to be late for that. I really like that the challenge description says I can focus on what I think is important. From my experience I know it's very important to provide domain experts with flexible reporting tools so they can look for valuable insights. Also, it's very important to be one step ahead of your competetives and meet time-to-market requriements. So I decided to build a report builder instead of a static report so that domain experts can view the data at different angles and at different granularity. Though I could write a lot of layers, implement a number of patterns to show off I decided to implement my idea with as little code as possible to show you that I know how harmful overengineering could be to the business but it doesn't mean I'm not aware of best practices and I don't follow latest technologies and I can prove it you if you decide to invite me to the interview. Hope you will like my idea and will assess my solution from business value perspective first.

### Solution details

1. You can just run my solution from Visual Studio or deploy it to IIS, there's no additional steps required.
2. I know my code is not ideal and I could polish it for ages but my idea was to focus on business value. If you decide to invite me to the interview we can discuss possible imrovements and I can elaborate on my decisions.
