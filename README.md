## Workflow

The changelog of what I have been working and developing day by day is located at:
[CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md).

The backlog of my personal tasks are located at:
[https://github.com/renanborgez/z/projects/1](https://github.com/renanborgez/z/projects/1)

For the purpose of this challenge I'm opening and closing my own PR inside the forked repository.
This helps me to review my own code and helps me to organize the "features" and changes that I'm
building.

## Development

The main technologies used in this project are: [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/) for running the
backend and all scripts tasks and [ReactJs](https://reactjs.org/) for the creating of the frontend
application.
