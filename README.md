# SnappetChallenge
This pull request features a small single page app. To create it i attempted to stick as close to the mentioned Snappet technologies as possible. 

### Technologies
- .NET C#
- Javascript, knockoutjs, requirejs, jquery
- No database used, just parsed the json, cached it, and sent it over to the client.

### Setup
I tried to make it as easy to install as possible, as long as you have the required microsoft stuff(.Net/visual studio) everything should work. Nuget should get the .net packages on build, and i used a CDN for all the javascript stuff.

### Hosting
I put it up on some free hosting in case something goes wrong, you can view it here aswell: http://rawne87-001-site1.etempurl.com/
