Hello!

The db is set up in mongodb atlas and hardcoded to connect and authenicate automtically. It's minimally styled as the focus was data orientated as to what teachers would like to see.

To run:

navigate to `./snappet-be` and run `yarn install`
run `nodemon app.js` in snappet-be to start the node server

In a new shell:

navigate to `./snappet-fe` and run `yarn install`
run `yarn start` to start the react server

open `localhost:3000` in the browser to launch

Use the calendar to navigate the month to see total progress for that day and a list of all completed activited per Subject/Domain
