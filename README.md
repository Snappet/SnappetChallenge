# SnappetChallenge
At [Snappet](http://www.snappet.org), we care about data and we care about code. When we interview for development positions, we want to see code and we want to discuss code. That's why we want candidates to show some work on our challenge. This challenge is not meant to cost you tons of time. A few hours should be enough. The challenge is defined very broadly. You could spend weeks on it, or half an hour. We understand that in 2 hours, you can only do so much. Don't worry about completeness, work on something that works and shows your skills.

### How to use
This project was built on Visual Studio 2017 Community 15.7.2 and .NET Core 2.0.
You need to install both:
- https://www.visualstudio.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Community&rel=15
- https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/thank-you/dotnet-sdk-2.1.200-windows-x64-installer

Then, you'll open the project with Visual Studio and press F5. A window will open with the report.
