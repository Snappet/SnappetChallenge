As the task conditions state that the work.json dataset doesn't show absolute value, but only changes, and it is unclear what does really mean.   
I got "Progress" as independent assesment (collected for me by uncomprehensible way) and I can get statistics as average value of each excercise
current progress * current Difficulty - previous progress * previous Difficulty / previous progress * previous Difficulty.
Maybe, my understanding of "Progress" is incorrect:)

Results of the program is progress of each student in each subject, which he has done by the certain time, relatively the previous lesson of this student in this subject;

To see result of the program you should:
1. have .net core 2.0;
2. run command: dotnet SnappetSolution.dll in SnappetSolution/publish folder (you can see address, the application is listening on, by default localhost:5000);
3. open a browser and enter the url you can see from the point above.

Enjoy it! :)
