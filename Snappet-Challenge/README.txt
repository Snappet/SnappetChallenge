Made a solution to the challenge in a .NET CORE Web Application, using razor pages.

The data is extracted from work.json.

Libraries used:
- Every base library that is installed starting a .NET CORE Web Application (Bootstrap, JQuery)
- Third party api: Google Charts


Running the program should not be a problem, starting up the project wil launch the initial page.
