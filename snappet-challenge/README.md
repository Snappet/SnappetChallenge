# SnappetChallenge

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.1.4.

## Background

The goal of this project is to give insight to the teachers in the progress
of the students in the classroom. This is done by comparing
the progress of the class against, another point in time and 
giving insight in the domain progress.

## Setup

The project was build with `angular 13.1.0`.
Make sure you have `node` and `npm` installed.

## Development server with mocks

Run `npm run start:fe:mock` for a dev server. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

* Visit [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to visit the SWAP
* Visit [localhost:3000/dev-interface](http://localhost:3000/dev-interface) to control the mock responses

Add new mock responses by adding or changing the .json files 
in the `snappet-challenge/ng-apimock/dev/mocks` or 
`snappet-challenge/ng-apimock/dev/mock-assets` directory.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.
