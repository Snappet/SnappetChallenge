# SnappetChallenge

This is a small WebApp that analyzes data from a JSON file.

To run it you need to have MS SQL LocalDB installed.

You run it from VS2022. When the application started, it creates the database "Snappet-ncalenic-20220116" on the LocalDB server.

The "Update database" item in the menu is used to load data from the JSON file into the database.

After loading the data into the MSSQL database, it is possible to see a couple of analyzes in tabular form via other menu items.
