# Snappet Assignment

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.6.

## Description
This project is a simple demonstration of the requested tasks of Snappet Assignment. Since the Objective of the project was broad, I just used some simple demonstrations of the data using charts and a table. Because of the time shortage, I used simple tools like Charts.js and some Angular Material components.

## Installation
Run `npm install` to install the dependencies, then you can choose to serve or build the application. Please sure that if you are running `ng serve` without any options, your `4200` is available.

## API Dependency Note
This project needs **snappet-assignment-backend** project running in background, otherwise, no data will be available. 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Contact me

Although I tried to implement everything with simplicity, please feel free to contact me if any part of the project needs more description.
